* SOLVED solve nfs connection issue
  - State "SOLVED"     from "UPDATE"     [2018-10-29 Mon 14:00] \\
    mount -t nfs -o nolock 192.168.1.151:/nfsroot /mnt
  - State "UPDATE"     from "UPDATE"     [2018-10-29 Mon 13:08] \\
    nfs version depends on param vers=3 or vers=4
  - State "UPDATE"     from "IN-PROGRESS" [2018-10-29 Mon 11:44] \\
    mount -t -maproot=root -o proto=tcp,port=2049 192.168.1.151:/nfsroot /mnt/nfs
  - State "IN-PROGRESS" from "IN-PROGRESS" [2018-10-25 Thu 14:13] \\
    tried all methods, still got *permission denied* issue
  - State "IN-PROGRESS" from "TODO"       [2018-10-25 Thu 14:12] \\
    don't have *apt* and *apt-get* command, cannot install tft or reinstall nfs
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-25 Thu 10:30] \\
    even under root, still got permission denied issue
* IN-PROGRESS build ive environment on another pc
  - State "IN-PROGRESS" from "TODO"       [2018-10-26 Fri 16:18] \\
    boost is ok, but opencv has make issue
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-25 Thu 17:34] \\
    set up ive, test prediction time
* DONE test rgb time
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2018-10-29 Mon 15:03] \\
    time is 0.6 ms per image
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-29 Mon 10:59] \\
    test Dollar rgb time
* TODO learn (opencv)SVM according to pdf guide
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-29 Mon 11:03] \\
    use cnn to extract features, then use svm to predict, but this svm is a part of opencv.
* IN-PROGRESS add r,g,b to mnist samples
  - State "IN-PROGRESS" from "TODO"       [2018-10-29 Mon 15:13] \\
    if [0,0,0], replace with 
    [255,0,0] - r
    [0,255,0] - g
    [0,0,255] - b
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-29 Mon 11:01] \\
    turn mnist samples to rgb images, extend categories like red0, green0, blue0. Then, test accuracy and time.
* IN-PROGRESS test rgb bin file on camera
  - State "IN-PROGRESS" from "TODO"       [2018-10-29 Mon 15:04] \\
    no source code, cannot test with bin file in camera
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-29 Mon 11:11] \\
    after solving nfs issue, validate rgb bin file
