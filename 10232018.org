* DONE run mnist example with ive tool
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2018-10-19 Fri 11:18] \\
    trained and tested successfully, but accuracy goes down.
    Besides, for dim range [0,1024], won't work for Alexnet, works on lenet, but accuracy goes down in a way
  - State "TODO"       from "NEXT"       [2018-10-19 Fri 10:58] \\
    solved all compiling issue, start to run example
  - State "NEXT"       from              [2018-10-18 Thu 15:08] \\
    run example first, then apply it to our project
** SOLVED modify network until it's compatible with ive tool
   - State "SOLVED"     from "BUG"        [2018-10-19 Fri 11:10] \\
     reduced all num_output, except for last one: 20/50/500/10 to 15/25/200/10
   - State "BUG"        from              [2018-10-19 Fri 11:02] \\
     fcl_input_dim(1800) is out of [1, 1024]
  - modified kernel size of convolution_param in conv1 and conv2 from 5 to 3 
* DONE customize lenet in terms of API reference P132
  - State "DONE"       from "NEXT"       [2018-10-19 Fri 11:21] \\
    customized by ive tool, but the suggestion of ive tool is not good for model network.

    have a meeting at 5, so do it tomorrow.
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-17 Wed 13:10] \\
    supprot 8 layers at most, only support 3x3....
* DONE convert caffemodel to bin
  - State "DONE"       from "UPDATE"     [2018-10-22 Mon 11:40] \\
    transfer caffemodel to bin file successfully
  - State "UPDATE"     from "TODO"       [2018-10-19 Fri 16:23] \\
    rebuild mnist according to guide, for now working on creating lmdb script
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-19 Fri 14:52] \\
    check whether it can convert caffemodel to bin, though ive tool is not good
* DONE use rgb samples to train on mnist
  - State "DONE"       from "UPDATE"     [2018-10-23 Tue 17:18] \\
    accuracy is 0.76, need to optimize it later
  - State "UPDATE"     from "IN-PROGRESS" [2018-10-22 Mon 17:25] \\
    trained once, and generate 32x32 test lib, try to test with this lib
  - State "IN-PROGRESS" from "TODO"       [2018-10-22 Mon 15:02] \\
    based on PCB samples
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-19 Fri 16:25] \\
    after converting caffemodel to bin
* BUG add a 3x3 conv kernel
  - State "BUG"        from "TODO"       [2018-10-22 Mon 14:18] \\
    ip1 layer has an issue when predict with deploy.prototxt, it shows "copy 0 weights error"
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-22 Mon 09:28] \\
    add a 3x3 to make up for removing 5x5
* TODO optimize lenet for rgb samples
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-23 Tue 17:19] \\
    improve accuracy
