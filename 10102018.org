** TODO modify output_num
   - State "TODO"       from "DONE"       [2018-10-10 Wed 10:04] \\
     1, 20/60... or lower than this value, because image is too small
     - loss is oscillating at 2.4
     2, 16/48... or as mentioned above
     - tried this set of numbers, but still has a oscillation at 2.4
** TODO modify filter size
   - State "TODO"       from "TODO"       [2018-10-10 Wed 10:07] \\

     2, size = 5
     3, size = 3
