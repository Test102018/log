    set up ive, test prediction time

    time is 0.6 ms per image

    solve all issues in code so that it can split images & train svm & predict
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-29 Mon 11:03] \\
    use cnn to extract features, then use svm to predict, but this svm is a part of opencv.
* DONE add r,g,b to mnist samples

    if [0,0,0], replace with 
    [255,0,0] - r

    turn mnist samples to rgb images, extend categories like red0, green0, blue0. Then, test accuracy and time.
* IN-PROGRESS test rgb bin file on camera
  - State "IN-PROGRESS" from "TODO"       [2018-10-29 Mon 15:04] \\
    no source code, cannot test with bin file in camera
  - State "TODO"       from              [2018-10-29 Mon 11:11] \\
    after solving nfs issue, validate rgb bin file
* learn HOG algorithm in OpenCV
